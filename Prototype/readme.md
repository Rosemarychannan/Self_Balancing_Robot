# Marking Rubric
1. Your robot should be fully assembled for this demo.


The Arduino board together with
the motor driver(s) should be mounted on a breadboard on the 2nd floor. Only the
bench power supply must be used for this demo (not the battery pack). You must
show an assembled robot before proceeding to the next step.

2. Without the wheels touching any surface, demonstrate the following:

• Drive motors at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of maximum rpm in one direction (both
motors at the same time) and show the PWM signals at the motor drivers
outputs on the oscilloscope.

• Drive motors at 25% and 75% of maximum rpm in the opposite direction (both
motors at the same time) - no need to show PWM.

• Drive motors at 25% and 75% of maximum rpm in opposite directions of each
other - no need to show PWM.

• Reverse directions and repeat the step above.

• Drive the motors such that the rpm is proportional to the angle of tilt from the
vertical position. Show a 0 rpm motor speed at the vertical position. Incline the
bot in both directions with respect to the vertical, and show how the motor
speed increases proportionally with the angle. Both motors should rotate in the
same direction - no need to show PWM.
